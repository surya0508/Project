Summer Project in Lockdown

1.Fake News detection using Machine Learning 
Fake news detector steps:

    ---->Prepare Dataset from kaggle
    ---->Data preprocessing (Cleaning,scrubbing)
    ---->NLP Techniques(SNoise removal,bag of words,Tf,IDF,count vectorizer)
    ---->Model building(Model train and test using Naive Bayes)
    ---->Evaluate and confusion Matrix(Seaborn heatmap)
